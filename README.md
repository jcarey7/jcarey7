🎲 Interests
When I'm not crunching numbers, you'll find me deep in a chess game (proud to be in the top 1% on chess.com), traveling to new places, or cheering at a football match. I believe in a balanced life - one where work, learning, and play all have their place.

📫 Reach out to me: I'm always open to connecting with fellow data enthusiasts, chess players, and travelers. Let's share stories and insights!
